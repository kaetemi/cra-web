We want to create a client-side scripted demo webpage for the Chroma Rotation Averaging (CRA) scripts that are under the scripts folder. The plan is outlined in PLAN.md, make sure to refer to this. This is a specialized histogram-based color matching technique. The user will put an input and reference image and choose from "RGB", "Lab", "CRA RGB", "CRA RGB Perceptual", "CRA Lab", "CRA Lab Tiled", "CRA Lab Tiled AB". There should be some description of what these are once selected, see scripts/README.md. Track your progress and next steps in PROGRESS.md.
